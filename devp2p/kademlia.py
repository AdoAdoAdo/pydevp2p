"""


Node discovery and network formation are implemented via a kademlia-like protocol.
The major differences are that packets are signed, node ids are the public keys, and
DHT-related features are excluded. The FIND_VALUE and STORE packets are not implemented.
The parameters necessary to implement the protocol are a
bucket size of 16 (denoted k in Kademlia),
concurrency of 3 (denoted alpha in Kademlia),
and 8 bits per hop (denoted b in Kademlia) for routing.
The eviction check interval is 75 milliseconds,
request timeouts are 300ms, and
the idle bucket-refresh interval is 3600 seconds.

Aside from the previously described exclusions, node discovery closely follows system
and protocol described by Maymounkov and Mazieres.

How many peers to connect to?

    """
    Each k-bucket is kept sorted by time last seen—least-recently seen node at the head,
    most-recently seen at the tail. For small values of i, the k-buckets will generally
    be empty (as no appro- priate nodes will exist). For large values of i, the lists can
    grow up to size k, where k is a system-wide repli- cation parameter.
    k is chosen such that any given k nodes are very unlikely to fail within an hour of
    each other (for example k = 20).

    When a Kademlia node receives any message (re- quest or reply) from another node,
    it updates the appropriate k-bucket for the sender’s node ID. If the sending node
    already exists in the recipient’s k- bucket, the recipient moves it to the tail of the list.

    If the node is not already in the appropriate k-bucket and the bucket has fewer than k
    entries, then the recipient just inserts the new sender at the tail of the list.

    If the  appropriate k-bucket is full, however, then the recipient pings the k-bucket’s
    least-recently seen node to decide what to do.

    If the least-recently seen node fails to respond, it is evicted from the k-bucket and
    the new sender inserted at the tail.

    Otherwise, if the least-recently seen node responds, it is moved to the tail of the list,
    and the new sender’s contact is discarded.

    k-buckets effectively implement a least-recently seen eviction policy, except that
    live nodes are never removed from the list.
